- title: 'Reusable PR-merge and tag based workflows'
  description: |
    *From GEOIPS#562: 2024-09-24, 1.14.1 updates*

     Since PR-merge and tag based workflows can not be run
     via repository rulesets, create reusable workflows
     that we can call from each repository.  The workflows
     included in the sync directory call these reusable workflows.
     Eventually we will move all actions to this repository as
     repository rulesets (since that will allow us to use these
     workflows from repositories outside the organization, supporting
     our collaborators), but for now start with the PR-merge and
     tag based workflows which we could not run across the organization
     via rulesets.

    Add common files between all repositories.  This includes the
    new workflows that call the geoips_ci reusable workflows, as
    well as automated linting config files (for automated consistent
    linting across all geoips plugins), and other standard files.
